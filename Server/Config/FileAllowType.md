In your current `multer-storage-cloudinary` setup, you're allowing the following file types:

-   **PDF** (`pdf`)
-   **Word Documents** (`doc`, `docx`)
-   **Images** (`png`, `jpg`)

### **Expanding Allowed File Types**

You can allow more file types by adding them to the `allowedFormats` array. Here are some common ones:

#### **More Document Types:**

-   `txt` â†’ Plain text files
-   `xls`, `xlsx` â†’ Excel spreadsheets
-   `ppt`, `pptx` â†’ PowerPoint presentations
-   `csv` â†’ Comma-separated values

#### **More Image Types:**

-   `jpeg` â†’ Some systems differentiate between `jpg` and `jpeg`
-   `gif` â†’ GIF images
-   `svg` â†’ Scalable vector graphics
-   `webp` â†’ Modern web-friendly image format

#### **Audio & Video Files (If Needed):**

-   `mp3`, `wav` â†’ Audio files
-   `mp4`, `mov`, `avi` â†’ Video files

### **Updated Code Allowing More Types**

```js
const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
    cloudinary: cloudinary,
    params: {
        folder: "collage",
        allowedFormats: [
            "pdf",
            "doc",
            "docx",
            "txt",
            "xls",
            "xlsx",
            "ppt",
            "pptx",
            "csv",
            "png",
            "jpg",
            "jpeg",
            "gif",
            "svg",
            "webp",
            "mp3",
            "wav",
            "mp4",
            "mov",
            "avi",
        ],
    },
});
```

#### **Are There Any Limits?**

Cloudinary doesn't enforce a strict limit on the number of allowed formats, but it **only supports certain file types**. You can check their [supported formats](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations#supported_image_formats) for images, videos, and documents.
