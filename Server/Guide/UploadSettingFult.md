Your upload is working, but the issue is likely with the Cloudinary URL in your database. Hereâ€™s what might be wrong and how to fix it:

---

### **Possible Issues & Fixes**

#### **1. `req.file.path` is incorrect**

You're saving the file URL using `req.file.path`, but in Cloudinary, the correct URL should be `req.file.secure_url`.

âœ… **Fix:** Update your controller:

```javascript
const newNote = new Note({
    title,
    description,
    fileUrl: req.file.secure_url, // Use secure_url instead of path
    uploadedBy: req.user.id,
    session,
    course,
    branch,
    semester,
    subject,
});
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Why?** `req.file.path` is not the Cloudinary URL; it's meant for local storage. Cloudinary provides `secure_url` for public access.

#### **2. File Not Uploading to Correct Folder**

You're specifying `folder: "collage"` in Multer, but:

-   If Cloudinary doesnâ€™t have that folder, it might be auto-created.
-   If the file is missing, something went wrong in the upload.

âœ… **Check in Cloudinary Dashboard:**

1. Log into [Cloudinary Console](https://cloudinary.com/console).
2. Go to the **Media Library**.
3. Search for your file (`n6kpovyyfekxslvmkdxs.png`).
4. If itâ€™s missing, your upload isn't working correctly.

#### **3. Cloudinary Storage Configuration Issue**

Your `allowedFormats` in Multer should be `format`, not `allowedFormats`.

âœ… **Fix:**  
Update `multer-storage-cloudinary` config:

```javascript
const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
    cloudinary: cloudinary,
    params: {
        folder: "collage",
        format: async (req, file) => file.mimetype.split("/")[1], // Ensure correct format
        resource_type: "auto", // Allows any file type (image, pdf, etc.)
    },
});
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Why?** `allowedFormats` is incorrect; `format` should be dynamic.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Update the controller** (`req.file.secure_url`).
2. **Check Cloudinary to see if the file exists**.
3. **Update the storage configuration** (`format` and `resource_type`).

Try this and let me know if you still face issues! ðŸš€
