This document outlines the copyrightable elements of this application, emphasizing its unique and original components.

## Original Components Subject to Copyright Protection

### 1. Complete Source Code

The entire source code of the College Notes Management System, including both client-side and server-side components, as an integrated work representing original creative expression. This includes:

-   Server-side implementation (Node.js/Express/MongoDB)
-   Client-side implementation (React/Vite/Tailwind CSS)
-   Database schemas and models
-   Authentication and authorization systems
-   File handling and cloud storage integration

### 2. Unique Implementation Elements

#### Multi-Tier Educational Content Organization Framework

The system implements a distinctive hierarchical organization structure specifically designed for educational institutions:

```javascript
// From Server/Models/Note.js
{
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    description: { type: String },
    fileUrl: { type: String, required: true },
    // Dynamic reference system for uploadedBy
    uploadedBy: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        refPath: 'uploaderModel',
        required: true
    },
    uploaderModel: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        enum: ['User', 'Admin']
    },
    // Hierarchical structure for educational content
    session: { type: String, required: true },
    course: { type: String, required: true },
    branch: { type: String, required: true },
    semester: { type: String, required: true },
    subject: { type: String, required: true }
}
```

This implementation uniquely combines:

-   A four-level academic hierarchy (Course → Branch → Semester → Subject)
-   A dynamic reference system allowing different user types to contribute content
-   Structured metadata for advanced searching and filtering

#### Triple-Role Authentication and Access Control System

The application features a distinctive three-tier role-based access control system with specialized permissions and capabilities for each role:

-   Students: Access, search, and provide feedback on academic materials
-   Administrators: Content management, user oversight, and feedback response
-   Super Administrators: System-wide configuration and administration

Each role has unique verification processes, token handling, and permissions enforcement through middleware:

```javascript
// Authentication middleware with role-based access control
export const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
    // Try to get token from cookie first, then fall back to header
    const token = req.cookies.authToken || req.header("Authorization");

    if (!token)
        return res
            .status(401)
            .json({ message: "Access denied! No token provided" });

    try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        req.user = decoded; // Attach user data to request
        next();
    } catch (error) {
        // Clear invalid cookie if present
        if (req.cookies.authToken) {
            res.cookie("authToken", "", {
                httpOnly: true,
                expires: new Date(0),
            });
        }
        res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid token" });
    }
};

// Role-based middleware
export const authorizeAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.user.role !== "admin") {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: "Access denied! Admins only" });
    }
    next();
};
```

#### Multi-Modal Email Verification System

The application implements a distinctive email verification system with:

-   Role-specific verification flows
-   Custom email templates for different user types
-   Dedicated verification controllers and routes
-   EJS-based email verification rendering

#### Integrated Academic Feedback Loop

A specialized feedback system connecting user experiences directly to academic resources:

-   Structured feedback submission tied to specific academic materials
-   Administrator review interfaces
-   Resolution tracking and response mechanisms

#### Dual Authentication System with Hybrid Storage

The frontend implements a unique authentication approach that blends cookie-based and localStorage authentication mechanisms:

```javascript
// From Client/src/Context/AuthContext.jsx
const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
    const [admin, setAdmin] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [userToken, setUserToken] = useState(
        localStorage.getItem("authToken")
    );
    const [adminToken, setAdminToken] = useState(
        localStorage.getItem("authTokenAdmin")
    );
    const [authVerified, setAuthVerified] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        // First check for legacy localStorage authentication
        const storedUser = localStorage.getItem("user");
        const storedAdmin = localStorage.getItem("admin");

        // If local storage has user data, initialize state with it
        // ...

        // Then check for cookie-based authentication with the server
        const checkAuthStatus = async () => {
            try {
                // Attempt hybrid authentication using both cookie and token approaches
                // ...
            } catch (error) {
                // Intelligent fallback to localStorage if server authentication fails
                // ...
            }
        };

        checkAuthStatus();
    }, [userToken, adminToken]);

    // Additional authentication methods...
};
```

This hybrid approach provides several unique benefits:

-   Seamless transition between authentication methods
-   Fallback mechanisms when server connectivity is disrupted
-   Support for both modern secure cookie-based auth and backward compatibility
-   Automatic state reconciliation between server and client authentication

#### Parallel User/Admin Authentication Flows

The system implements a distinctive approach that maintains separate authentication states for regular users and administrators simultaneously:

```javascript
// From Client/src/Context/AuthContext.jsx
// Login for regular users
const login = async (credentials) => {
    try {
        const { data } = await API.post("/auth/login", credentials);

        // Set user data in state and localStorage for backward compatibility
        setUser(data.user);
        localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(data.user));

        // Authentication is now verified
        setAuthVerified(true);

        // Token management for backward compatibility
        // ...

        return { success: true };
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling...
    }
};

// Parallel but separate login for admin users
const Adminlogin = async (credentials) => {
    try {
        const { data } = await API.post("/auth/loginAdmin", credentials);

        // Set admin data in state and localStorage
        setAdmin(data.admin);
        localStorage.setItem("admin", JSON.stringify(data.admin));

        // Authentication is now verified
        setAuthVerified(true);

        // Admin token management
        // ...

        return { success: true };
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling...
    }
};
```

This parallel authentication system:

-   Maintains clear separation between user types
-   Supports different authentication endpoints and token types
-   Provides role-specific authentication flows
-   Implements intelligent state management to prevent conflicting authentication

#### Intelligent Role-Based Route Protection

The application's route protection system implements a unique approach to securing routes based on user roles while supporting multiple authentication methods:

```javascript
// From Client/src/Config/ProtectedUserRoute.jsx
const ProtectedUserRoute = () => {
    const { user, admin, loading } = useContext(AuthContext);

    // Show loading indicator while checking authentication status
    if (loading) {
        return (
            <div className="min-h-screen flex justify-center items-center">
                <div className="w-12 h-12 border-4 border-blue-600 border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin"></div>
            </div>
        );
    }

    // Check localStorage as fallback
    const Luser = localStorage.getItem("user");
    const Ladmin = localStorage.getItem("admin");

    // Allow access if user or admin is authenticated (via context or localStorage)
    return user || admin || Luser || Ladmin ? (
        <Outlet />
    ) : (
        <Navigate to="/login" replace />
    );
};
```

This protection system:

-   Verifies authentication through multiple channels
-   Provides visual feedback during authentication checks
-   Supports role-based access control
-   Implements fallback mechanisms for authentication verification

#### Hierarchical Component Navigation Structure

The React frontend implements a unique component structure that directly mirrors the educational hierarchy:

```javascript
// From Client/src/App.jsx
<Routes>
    {/* ... */}
    <Route element={<ProtectedUserRoute />}>
        <Route path="/courses" element={<Courses />} />
    </Route>
    <Route element={<ProtectedUserRoute />}>
        <Route path="/branch" element={<Branches />} />
    </Route>
    <Route element={<ProtectedUserRoute />}>
        <Route path="/semester" element={<Semester />} />
    </Route>
    <Route element={<ProtectedUserRoute />}>
        <Route path="/subjects" element={<Subjects />} />
    </Route>
    <Route element={<ProtectedUserRoute />}>
        <Route path="/notes" element={<NotesList />} />
    </Route>
    {/* ... */}
</Routes>
```

This component organization:

-   Creates an intuitive navigation system that reflects academic structures
-   Implements consistent protected routes across the hierarchy
-   Establishes a component hierarchy that maps directly to the data model
-   Provides consistent user experience through the educational navigation flow

### 3. Distinctive Architectural Patterns
